Getting started:
----------------

   First thing needed to be setup - is ruby + rubygems. Assuming this is OSX platform, both are already there.
   Next, we need to setup bundler: 
           sudo gem install bundler
   Finally, we install everything else using bundler: 
           bundle install


Basic Usage:
------------

The script for getting system stats is written as a Rakefile.
Invoking 'rake' in the same directory where Rakefile is located will
execute the script.
Alternatively, it can be invoked by supplying a path to Rakefile, eg:

rake -f /some/path/to/Rakefile

In the local use scenario (ie: without RRDTool), execution target must be given like this:

rake local

For more info on usage, type:

rake help


Deployment on remote host(s):
-----------------------------

The easiest way to invoke this script on a different host(s), is to use Capistrano.
The roles defined in Capfile must correspond to servers from which stats must be collected.
There are 2 targets written in Capfile:

a) cap install  : this will install Rakefile, Gemfile and bundler on target hosts, then run bundler to install all dependencies

                  Note: in order for this target to work, the user specified in the Capfile (cap_user) must be able to:
                        1. Login to all hosts without using password (using key authentication)
                        2. Execute 'sudo' on all hosts without having to type password. This can be achieved by making sure the user
	                   is part of 'wheel' group on all hosts and then uncommenting the following line in /etc/sudoers file:
	                   # %wheel        ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

b) cap getstats  : this will login to all hosts and run 'rake' command to get statistics about the system.


RRDTool:
--------

This utility is designed to work with RRDTool. In order to use this utility, rrdtool db had to be created on some host:


   (For example: rrdtool create monitor.rrd --start 1319525830 --step 300 DS:cpu:GAUGE:600:U:U \
                                                                          DS:procs:GAUGE:600:U:U \
									  DS:disk_usage:GAUGE:600:U:U \
									  RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:12:24)

Additionally, rrdcached has to be running on the same host where db was created:

   rrdcached -P FLUSH,UPDATE -l localhost:8888 -g -p /tmp/rrdcached.pid

Then, collecting stats on localhost only and sending data to rrdtool db can be done like this:

   rake HOST=localhost PORT=8888 FILE=/Users/sashka/work/system_monitor/monitor.rrd

In order to deploy on multiple hosts using Capistrano, Capfile must be edited to specify correct parameters for HOST, PORT and FILE.
